An iPhone app that displays Howcast Food & Drinks Guides.

TODO:
 * Save last viewed video
 * Caching?
 * Make Marker ("Steps") UITableViewCells custom--in order to display full
   marker text
 * Images? Plus settings toggle to enable/disable them.
 * Integrate Ingredients ("You Will Need") with some sort of "buy"
   functionality--maybe price comparisons of different vendors (if vendors have some sort of API)

Would be nice if:
 * Guides had a difficulty rating or time-to-complete duration

Uses:
 * Howcast API: http://groups.google.com/group/howcast-developers/web/api-documentation
 * TouchXML: http://code.google.com/p/touchcode/wiki/TouchXML
