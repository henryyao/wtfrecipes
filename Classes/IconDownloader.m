 Abstract: Helper object for managing the downloading of a particular app's icon.
 As a delegate "NSURLConnectionDelegate" is downloads the app icon in the background if it does not
 yet exist and works in conjunction with the RootViewController to manage which apps need their icon.
 
 A simple BOOL tracks whether or not a download is already in progress to avoid redundant requests.
